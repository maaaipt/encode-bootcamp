# SushiSwap
Differences. Uniswap give a grant to start uniswap, automatic market maker. Brakethorugh, decentralised had to go through an audible support. Challenges, not submitting at the same time, etc. Allowed to swap token instantly. Anyone can create a liquidity pool, to the world to use and swap tokens. Multiple versions of uniswap, v2 not long time ago. In June the locked coins went up a lot.
Yield farming attractive.

Yearn finance launched. Fair launch idea. Previously token would be pre mining, or pre selected. Later on . Not for a community. The projects would build a community for the launch. Instead of a VC or small amount of individuals. SushiSwap was, while UniSwap wasn't. Food coins, taking idea from some projects. Huge amount of appetite.

SushiSwap complaining about uniswap not being decentralised enough. They were attacking them. They wanted to to reward with LP, from Uniswap to SushiSwap LP tokens. Vampire attack, draining liquidity from UniSwap to SushiSwap. Taking advantage of the liquidity in Uniswap, transforming it into SushiSwap. MasterChef contract. Lots of people started using SushiSwap, went up the token value getting a lot of yield out of it. Control of this contract was entirely on ChefNomi.

Community realised on not trust anonymous teams with power, they are scarier. Uniswap releases gov tokens, causing network congestion on Eth for few days (gas fee high). HolaSwap fork but not compliant with copyright regulation. UniSwap v3 looks still healthier and going forward, as SushiSwap.

Speed of development very high. Vampire Attack, draining from one platform to another.
