# Some Exploit
- Binance Block Chain has good the reputation. Arbix was premeditated and they were audited by certain.

They had critical problems.

- Hot wallets being exploited in centralised exchanges.

# CREATE2

Problem when deploying contracts on test networks.

An example, give consistency in different networks. When they deployed using create2 it will mirror in order to get back the same results. Using the hash of the factory.


# DeFi Data

The Graph. It's a project to index data in blockchain, presented as a query database instead of a blockchain like ethereum. The Graph helps to make them more readable.

They have 3 products. Hosted service. A centralised way, initially used, now it's moving away from it.

Graph explorer will allow to play with it, each project as a schema and example queries.

At the top there're d.applications with tx that go to smart contracts that emits events.

The graph define nodes to help extract data and monitor events. They store the data and allow to make them available to people that wants to query them.

Roles involved in graph. An indexer node will do the mapping of events and put them in IPFS and posters database. Proof of indexing. Anyone can dispute indexers, called fishermen. They have a stake that can loose.


# Oracles

There were only few oracles at the beginning. Until Chainlink took over.

Data Feed is the most used product, allow to get prices of assets.

Verifiable Random Numbers inside contract can be done with this. It's not "easily" exploitable.

As contracts can't start tx, chainlink keepers allow to automate this. E.g. call at a particular circumstance/event or at every time.

# Decentralised Data Model

Data Aggregations. The more people involved the better the quality. The operators are incentives to provide the data. There'll be a min number of oracle.
