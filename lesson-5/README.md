Solidity
- inheritance
- variables types (enums, byte array, boolean, etc..)
- functions types
- constants/immutables (done in the constructor)
- interfaces
- receive/fallback to contract address (unique functions)
- handling errors (requires, assert, revert, try catch)
  - requires often used in modifiers
  - asserts it must not happen in the contract and it's considered not tollerable, stop the processing, indicades drastic problem
  - revert is similar to throw
  - try-catch when we call other contracts, cause they can fail for some reason in different ways
- import, done a compile time (flattening for verifying) and become part of the contract deployed
- runtime call of contracts (contract address, name of the functions to call, etc..)
