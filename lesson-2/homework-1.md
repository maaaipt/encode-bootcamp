> Imagine you are designing a new blockchain system
> What behaviour / aspects of the system do you want to encourage ? 
The system should be incentivising cooperatation with rules.
Rules should be clear and publicly available by anyone. Rules helps to define a clear direction that nodes are incentivised to follow. Making it hard, but not impossibolie, to go against it.
To provide communal cooperation reward should be provided to who work for the benefit of the network.



> What behaviour / aspects of the system do you want to discourage ?
It should be discouraged actions that go against the other working nodes in the network.


> What means do you have for this incentivisation ?
 Definition of the rules, environment provided, code, support.

Game theory











Concept of consensus in cumputer science. Like Bizantine Fault Tollerance, where even if part of the data received by a node are wrong/go-against the intentioned direction, the entity can address that and act accordingly.

Avoid the double spending problem, through proof of work. Work could be linked to solve a hard puzzle. It can time to produce it (Bitcoin 10 mins). Protocol is able to adjust the difficulty of the work up or down (e.g. over time). Reward of work is well defined and limited. Accepting that there'll be malicious nodes, but dicentivising them from doing bad things.


Avoid fooling the system, the other nodes (classic 51% attack).

A risk is that practically there could be a de facto centralisation of who can execute the work. As well practically the work can have a side effect (actual power consumption).

Alternative to proof of work, for a consensus mechanism. Like, proof of authority, history, burn, elapsed time, spacetime, etc.




Ths system should have some properties: liveness, correctness, fairness,
