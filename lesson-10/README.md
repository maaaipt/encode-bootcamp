# Decentralised Storage

- Pratical session. Coding
- From an authority/central entity to decentralised entities
- DeFi (Finance), Computer Power (ethereum), storage (Storj, IPFS)
- IPFS fantastic tool

Centralised
- Facebook, Netflix, etc.

Decentralised is not distributed
- Oracles and bootstrap nodes.
- Mining nodes, just normal nodes, etc.
- Generally more reliable access to data if the system run properly (this might not be always true)

Distributed
- All nodes interconnected and equally
- More robust, but also complex
- Each node has to be self aware, set of rules to adhere, talk to other nodes in a trusted matter

Decentralised Storage
- NFT.storage is free, but 
- Pointer in a contract
- Filecoin, api slow, clunky, but they are improving


Few examples
- Safe Network
One of the oldest. Nice thing run on own computers.
- 0Chain
private and anonymous sharing
- Ocean
Computer to data model. You can buy others data, but you get the process, not the readability of those. It's still possible to monetise data, keeping privacy
- Swarm
Storage and communication inside ethereum
- ethereum
Terabytes of data, quite cheap, token on ethereum
- Sia
Use proof of work and storage
- Filecoin
More popular. Incentives with tokens, proof of space and replication. It uses the hash of the data as an addressing system
- IPFS
More popular. Inter planetary file system. By Protocol Labs. Not restricted to have it online, could be offline, it's quite flexible. It can be private or public.

- IPFS+Arweave might be a good solution

## IPFS
- At starting the local node will talk to bootstrap nodes
- encrypt first all your data locally before putting them online.
- IPFS does not have encryption by default
- do not trust that the data is going to be there, as they might not guarantee that it's there.
