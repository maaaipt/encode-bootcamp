# Summary

- Remix can connect to MetaMask
- Etherscan always usefull to understand and debug

## GITPOD
- Already setup workspaces
- Add workspaces easily (good for homerworks)
- Help setup quickly
- Hardhat can be used too
- Can connect to VSCode too or just browser
- Drawback, sourcecode with contracts does not have an easy way to integrate with git (might require a lot of copy/paste)
- After two weeks workspaces will get deleted
- 


## Truffle & Ganache
- Truffle is quite a good platform with different components
- Ganache is a little blockchain, that looks like a node, but it's local and efficient. Without a test network, similar to the JS VM.
- installed with npm (also comes as an app)
- Gives some accounts preloaded with ETH (with private keys too).
- Quite usefull as a boilerplate code, being able to interact with different blockchains
- Boxes, provides with contracts implementing tokens and little website that helps interact with the token (very good examples). Used with webpack. nightfall, zero knowledge proof.
- 

## Drizzle
- building blocks for UI and Frontend



# HardHat
- console.log in contracts
- althought is better to use events for transactions, it's not ideal to put too many just for the sake of debugging
- Web3js or Waffle/Ethers
- Unit test can be convenient
- Nice feature like plugins integrating with truffle and waffle
